# Template
- Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
  Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

# Strategy
- Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 
  Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
